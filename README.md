# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System  
  
## Libraries Used  
imutils, cv2, os, datetime, face_recognition, pickle, numpy, pandas, streamlit  
  
## About the Project 
This system can be converted to a computer software which can then be connected to a external camera (or web cam will do). This system runs locally which works on the principle of facial recognition , it recognises the Employee/Student faces and marks their attendance in a csv file and then sends an email to the attendance manager (or whomsoever it may concern).  
  
- Inputs taken :-User just need to enter the path to the employee/student images and an email adress where the final attendance csv with names and time for a particular day can be sent.   
- Output:- An Email to the head , containing list of all Employees/Students who have marked their attendance by looking into the camera  
  
### Scope of this Project  
This type of syste can be installed in offices or schools wherever attendance marking is a mandatory task and this type of system saves a lot of time for marking attendance.
